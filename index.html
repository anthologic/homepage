    <p id="second">Gates was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. In 1975, he co-founded Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It went on to become the world's largest personal computer software company.<sup>[4][a]</sup> Gates led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, but he remained chairman and became chief software architect.<sup>[7]</sup> During the late 1990s, he had been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.<sup>[8]</sup> In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation that he and his wife, Melinda Gates, established in 2000.<sup>[9]</sup> He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie.<sup>[10]</sup> He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.<sup>[11]</sup> In March 2020, Gates left his board positions at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic endeavors including climate change, global health and development, and education.<sup>[12]</sup></p>

    <p>Since 1987, he has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people.<sup>[13][14]</sup> From 1995 to 2017, he held the Forbes title of the richest person in the world all but four of those years.<sup>[15]</sup> In October 2017, he was surpassed by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net worth of US$90.6 billion compared to Gates's net worth of US$89.9 billion at the time.<sup>[16]</sup> As of January 2021, Gates had an estimated net worth of US$163 billion, making him the third-richest person in the world.<sup>[17]</sup></p>

    <p id="last">Later in his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008, Gates has pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He has given sizable amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, reported to be the world's largest private charity.<sup>[18]</sup> In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.<sup>[19]</sup></p>
